It uses ODS LAYOUT GRIDDED to organize the visual output into two columns, each showing a heatmap of plant species (y-axis) across months (x-axis). The dataset dst4_modified is filtered into native and non-native plots, and for each, it plots how flowering activity (via PlantSpecies_Year) is distributed over time (May‚ÄìOctober). Color intensities range from peachpuff to firebrick, visually highlighting blooming trends. This allows for a clear, compact comparison of seasonal flowering behavior between plant types. üåº","outputs":[]}]
